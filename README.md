## Description

I started the project with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.

I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one

I made some changes in index.js and css/styles.css files, and make the functionality of the project in js/app.js file.

## Development

- make the structure of Project.

- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

- make a scroll spy

- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

  - make a responsive navbar
  - add media queries to .landing\_\_container
  - used font-size: clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX); Property to make most of fonts responsive

- There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.

- The ReadMe file should have non-default text in it.

- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting.
